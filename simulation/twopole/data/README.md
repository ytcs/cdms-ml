# Benchmark dataset for two-pole simulation

In this dataset there are ```N```=500,000 fake traces with ```tlen```=1024 generated by the following function:

```python
def twopole_function(tlen, A, tau1, tau2, t0):
    t = np.arange(tlen).reshape((1,-1))
    pulse = (
        np.heaviside(t - t0, 0)
        * np.exp(-(t - t0) / tau1)
        * (1 - np.exp(-(t - t0) / tau2))
    )
    return pulse / np.max(pulse) * A
```

The four parameters ```A```,```tau1```,```tau2```,```t0``` were randomly selected from the ranges [0,1), [5,50), [10,50) and [200,800).

The file ```twopole-params.npy``` contains a numpy array of shape ```(N,4)``` that stores the four params ```[A,tau1,tau2,t0]``` for each trace. This is the input for this task.

The file ```twopole-traces.npy``` contains a numpy array of shape ```(N,tlen)``` that stores the traces. This is the output for this task.
