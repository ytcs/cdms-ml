# Simulating ideal two-pole pulses

For this task we aim to learn an analytical two-pole function using a neural network. The input of this network will be various paramters such as amplitude and time constants, and the network should output a corresponding time trace that is given by the two-pole function with the input parameters.

This task is a stepping stone towards building a full DMC neural network.

## Dataset 
See the ```data``` folder

## Scoring

1. Performance score

Performance is ranked by ```1-sqrt(MSE)``` over the **entire** dataset:
```python
score = 1-np.sqrt(np.mean(np.square(traces-predicted_traces)))
```

As part of the task specification you should have a minimum validation split of 20%. You should not train with the entire dataset otherwise your result will not be counted.

2. Physics Score

Frequently the network will converge to an unphysical saddle point which has a high performance score on the dataset but doesn't actually understand the physics. In this task the physicality of the network will be gauged by the PSD of noise traces generated by the network. Concretely, we set the ```A``` to 0 for all inputs in this dataset, then have the network predict some traces. If the traces predicted deviates greatly from flat noise, the model is deemed unphysical and receives ```0``` for physicality, otherwise it receives ```1```. An unphysical model is not useful even if the performance score is high.

## Submission

You should save your model as a Keras model using ```keras.models.save()```. Tarballs or ```.keras``` files are both accepted. Please submit a pull request if you have a model that performs better than the top model in the current ranking. For models that contain custom loss functions/layers, the ```compile=False``` option may be required when loading the model.
